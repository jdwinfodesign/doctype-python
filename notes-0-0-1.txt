Ran the script on a full set of files today, the alcuin files, which was not randomly chosen exactly but was of equal utility, as the information set included a bunch of graphics files. No non-XML content files, but the graphics files provided some lessons I should have anticipated--proving once again that in Bismarck's estimation I would be considered a fool. 

There are 121 files in 15 folders. 
Only 18 files were processed, four in the root folder and the rest in two immediate children of the root folder.
Those were in the folder names "appendices" (six files) and "frontmatter" (8 files) 
Processing stopped on the first file in the "graphics" folder, which was the next folder in alphabetical order. 
Obviously, the program stopped when it could not parse the binary format files (PNG and PPTX). 

So, the next step would be to include a check of the file type or file extension so that the script attempts to open only XML files.
